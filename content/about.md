I've been doing tech since about 2019.

Started out doing a bit of everything â€” from building bots and RESTful web-servers to writing bash scripts and even training simple neural networks using TensorFlow.

Nowadays, **my main focus is developing cross-platform apps with Flutter**. 

In my free time, I like to dive into algorithms, how compilers work, and the basics of programming language design.
